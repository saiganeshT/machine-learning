### Goal 
To build a very simple image classifier using K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm

### Dataset
The dataset contains images of people having and not having burns. It is a small dataset

### features
The features for the KNN algorithm is the average value of (R, B, G) channels for each image. Which makes it very easy to train the algorithm but we will lose a lot of information.

### hyper-parameter tuning
Different k values are searched to get the best results
